We want to create the database for the restoration operations carried out at a museum. Each work of art is identified by a progressive number and the name of the author who made it; we also know the year of realization and the current quotation of the value of the work. 
Restoration operations are identified by a unique code and are characterized by the name of the operation. Restoration operations can be consolidation or recomposition. For the recomposition you know the list of tools to be used. For consolidation operations you know the material to be used.
The materials used in the restoration operations are identified by a unique code and are characterized by the name and a description. For each material, the database stores the suppliers to whom the museum is addressed and the date of the last relative supply. Each supplier is identified by the VAT number and characterized by a telephone number and an email address (if available). Consider that each material can be supplied by multiple suppliers and that each supplier can provide multiple materials. 
In the databases you want to store the restoration operations carried out over time on each work of art. Consider that, on the same work of art, the same restoration operation can be carried out several times, on different dates, and that different restoration operations can be carried out on the same date. Also consider that the same restoration operation can be performed on several works of art on the same day, but only once a day for each work of art. The cost of restoration operations varies over time. You want to keep track of the cost assumed by each restoration operation in different time intervals (characterized by start date and end date).
