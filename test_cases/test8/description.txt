We want to create a database for an online newspaper publisher.
The newspapers published by the publisher are identified by a unique code, and their name and year of foundation are known.
Members of the editorial board of the newspapers are identified by their email address, and their name, surname, and a phone number (if available) are known.
For each member of the editorial board, we want to keep track of the roles held in each newspaper and the periods (start date and end date) during which they held that role. Consider that, during the same period, each member of the board can hold a role in different newspapers but cannot hold multiple roles in the same newspaper. A member of the editorial board can hold the same role multiple times for the same newspaper.
The volumes published for each newspaper are identified by a unique progressive number within the reference newspaper and are characterized by the year and month of publication and the name of the editorial board member who oversaw the publication of that volume.
Within each volume, articles are published. Each article is identified by a unique code within the reference volume and is characterized by the title, the number of pages, and the list of authors. Articles can be freely accessible or paid. For freely accessible articles, the type of access is known (for example, "Bronze," "Gold," or "Diamond"), while for paid articles, the cost to purchase the article is known.
