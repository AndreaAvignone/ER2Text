You are requested to create the database for managing a cluster of servers.
Each server  in the cluster is identified by a unique code and its brand, date of purchase, and IP address are known. Servers can be of the following types: CPU-equipped servers, GPU-equipped servers or both. For servers with CPUs, the number of CPUs and the amount of RAM available (in GB) are known. For servers with GPUs, the number of GPUs and the amount of VRAM available (in GB) are known.
Users who access the cluster are identified by their tax ID; the email address and a telephone number (if available) are known.
It is requested to track user utilization  only for servers with at least one GPU. Each period of use is described by the GPU server that was  used, the user who used it, the period of use (indicated by the start date and time, and the end date and time) and the cost of use. Consider  that each user can use the same GPU server multiple times over different periods of time,    and that multiple different users  can use the same GPU server at the same time. 
In the event of problems, users can send reports to cluster administrators. Each report is characterized by the user who sent it, a timestamp indicating the instant in which the report was sent, the   administrator who will have to manage it and a brief description. Consider that at any time (timestamp) each user can send only one report; The same administrator can handle multiple reports at the same time.
Cluster administrators  are identified by a unique code; they are described by their first name, last name, list of phone numbers, and list of permissions they have on the cluster. Each permission is identified by a unique code and is characterized by a textual description. For each administrator you want to memorize the reason for which each permission was assigned.
