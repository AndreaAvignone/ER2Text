We want to create the database for the management of boat rental at a sports club. To rent a boat you  need to become a member of the sports club by signing a membership card.  The members of the club are characterized by the number of the membership card, the name, the surname, a telephone number, and the number of the nautical license (if available). 
Each boat is identified by a unique numerical code and is characterized by the name of the manufacturer and the year of construction.  For boats that have cabins, the list of optionals mounted on board (such as GPS, fridge, shower, oven, etc.) are known.  Each manufacturer is identified by a unique code and is characterized by the name and address of the registered office.You want to keep track of the boat rentals made by members. Each rental is characterized by the rented boat, the date on which the rental was made, the partner who made the rental and the rental cost.  Consider that a boat can be rented by at most one member on each day. Also consider that the same member can rent several different boats on the same day, and can rent the same boat several times but on different dates.
