You are requested to create a database for the management of a free-floating e-scooter sharing rental company working in the city of Torino. E-scooter are rented for short trips within the urban area.
●        Each e-scooter is identified by a unique code and it is characterized by the model and by the date of purchase by the company. For each scooter also its current geographical position (expressed as geographical coordinates) in the city area is available.
●        Company users are identified by a unique code. For each user also the name, surname and birthdate are known. In addition, a reference credit card number is available for each user.
●        Several membership fees are possible. Each membership fee is identified by a unique code and characterized by a name, a short description, the list of the necessary requirements, and the amount. For each user the corresponding membership fee is known.
●        We want to record in the database the list of users who rented each e-scooter on each date. Consider that (1) each user can rent different e-scooters on the same day and (2) the same e-scooter can be rented by more than one user on the same day.
●        We also want to record in the database the list of dates when each e-scooter has been out of order. For each date when the e-scooter was out of order a brief description of the reason is also stored.
