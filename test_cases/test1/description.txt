You are requested to create a database for management of a platform providing multimedia contents. Describe the Entity-Relationship diagram addressing the following specifications.
Platform users are identified by a unique code and characterized by nickname, email address, and their facebook page (if available). For users who financially support the platform, the sponsorship fee paid by the user is available.

Each multimedia content is identified by means of a numeric code and by the user who provided that content. Each multimedia content is also characterized by a name, a short textual description, and a list of keyworks. Additional information is available for each content type.
