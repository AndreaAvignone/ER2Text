You are requested to design the database of a medical screening center that performs radiology examinations. 
Staff working at the radiology department are identified by a unique code and they are characterized by name and surname. Staff can be either technicians (that take and supervise the exams), radiologists or engineers (that monitor the equipment). For technicians, the list of qualifications (if available) is known, whereas for radiologists the years of experience are known. 
Patients attending the screening center are identified by their SSN, and they are characterized by name, surname, date of birth, and phone number. 
Several scanners are available at the screening center. Each scanner is characterized by a unique identifier, the vendor, and optionally the date of the last software update. 
The database must register all exams that were performed on patients. For each exam, you are requested to store the patient who performed the exam, the exam date start and end time, the single technician who supervised the exam and the scanner on which it was executed. Additionally, the exam is characterized by its status (indicating whether the exam was complete or not) and possibly a list of symptoms reported by the patient. A patient can take multiple exams on the same date, but at different times. 
The database must also register all calibrations that were performed on each scanner. For each calibration performed on a scanner, the date, start time, end time and result are known. An engineer can calibrate multiple scanners, also on the same date. Multiple engineers may be required to perform a calibration on the same scanner, also on the same date. However, the same engineer may be required to calibrate the same scanner only once a day.
Radiologists can take refresher courses. A refresher course is identified by a unique identifier, and is associated with a title, the list of topics and the number of credits awarded. A radiologist can take multiple refresher courses, but she/he can take each course only once. For each radiologist and course, you need to register the date the course was taken and the evaluation the radiologist received at the end.
