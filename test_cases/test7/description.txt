The police need to design a database to collect information about the control of territory perfomed by its officers. Design the Entity-Relationship diagram according to the following specifications:
Police officers are characterized by a unique alphanumeric code, first name, last name, birth date, email, and list of phone numbers. 
Cities of the territory are identified by a unique code and characterized by name, size in squared km, and total population. Each city is divided into areas identified by a unique alphanumeric code within the city and described by the bounding box coordinates (i.e., topx, topy, bottomx, bottomy).
Officers monitor the areas of the territory. The database must keep track of the time periods in which each officer monitors an area. A time period is described by the start date, start time, end date (if available), and end time (if available). Each officer can monitor serval areas in the same time period, and the same area can be monitored by different officers.
